<body bgcolor=#ffffff><h1>ScoreBoard README</h1>
  This program runs the "electronic scoreboard" for the annual Jesuwon Community Church
  basketball tournament.
<p>
<p><h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
  The ScoreBoard is used to keep track of the points, show team names and jersey colors, and 
  record the number of timeouts avaiable. There is a control window which is meant 
  to be seen only by the operator to run the scoreboard.  There is another
  window which is contains the scoreboard display. The scoreboard is deigned to run on
  a dual monitor setup, where the operator contorls the scoreboard on one display
  and the scoreboard is displayed on another, larger display.
<p>
Included in this distribution is a file called "RUN.BAT" which is used to
start the scoreboard on Wintel PCs.  If you don't know what you're doing,
start there and you'll be able to figure it out.

<p><h3>CONTROLS</h3>
The control window has a variety of buttons and a few data entry fields which
the operator can use to run the scoreboard.  The buttons and fields are
described in the following sections.  Many of the buttons have both a "home"
and a "guest" version to control the two sides.  When this is the case, the
two buttons are described in one paragraph.
<ul>
<p><li><b>Home / Guest</b><p>
These buttons are used to customize the team's name in the upper text boxes
on the scoreboard.  Enter the team's name in the data entry field above
this button, then click this button to update the scoreboard.  The text fields
can also be used by the operator to help keep track of the team colors.
<p><li><b>Set Timer</b><p>
This button is used to set the clock on the scoreboard.  There is a data
entry field above this button where the user can enter the desired time

The value of this field depends on how the two monitors are setup.  If the main
screen is to the left, then this will be a positive value about 4 less than the
width of the main screen.  If the main screen is to the right, then this will

<p><h3>TECHNICAL</h3>
This program is written in Java and requires the appletviewer application 
which is only included with the Java 2 SDK.  You can obtain this freely
from http://java.sun.com/.  This has been tested using the Java2 1.4.2_19
SDK installation on a PC running Win98, although the development was done
under Linux (Fedora release 7) with the Java2 1.4.2_19 SDK.
