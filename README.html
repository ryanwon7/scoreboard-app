<body bgcolor=#ffffff><h1>ScoreBoard README</h1>
This program runs the "electronic scoreboard" for basketball and
volleyball in the Mount Olive Church Community Life Center.
<p>
Version 3.5 - January 6, 2009
<p><h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
The ScoreBoard is used to keep a countdown clock, track the score, track
the fouls (basketball only), track the sets (volleyball only), play sounds,
and run a slide show.  There is a control window which is meant 
to be seen only by the operator to run the scoreboard.  There is another
window which is contains the scoreboard display including the slide show.
The scoreboard display window is meant to be displayed on a secondary video
display which is projected on the big screen.  The size of the window's
contents are exactly 800x600 which should display clearly on a TV or
standard video display.
<p>
Included in this distribution is a file called "RUN.BAT" which is used to
start the scoreboard on Wintel PCs.  If you don't know what you're doing,
start there and you'll be able to figure it out.

<p><h3>SCREEN SNAPSHOTS</h3>
The following is a snapshot of the scoreboard display in basketball mode.
This is meant to be output to a second video card on the host computer which
is why this snapshot is shown without the "window dressings" that the operating
system provides.

The following is a snapshot of the scoreboard display in volleyball mode.
<p><center><img src="vballscore.jpg"></center><p>
The following are snapshots of the control window in both basketball and
volleyball mode (note that you will only see one of these at any time, not
both).  This is displayed on the desktop so that the operator can
interact with it.

</table>

<p><h3>CONTROLS</h3>
The control window has a variety of buttons and a few data entry fields which
the operator can use to run the scoreboard.  The buttons and fields are
described in the following sections.  Many of the buttons have both a "home"
and a "guest" version to control the two sides.  When this is the case, the
two buttons are described in one paragraph.
<ul>
<p><li><b>Home / Guest</b><p>
These buttons are used to customize the team's name in the upper text boxes
on the scoreboard.  Enter the team's name in the data entry field above
this button, then click this button to update the scoreboard.  The text fields
can also be used by the operator to help keep track of the team colors.
<p><li><b>Set Timer</b><p>
This button is used to set the clock on the scoreboard.  There is a data
entry field above this button where the user can enter the desired time
in the format Minutes:Seconds.Tenths (such as 5:00 for five minutes, or
10.2 for ten and two tenths seconds).  This button is only available in
basketball mode.

These buttons are used to add 2 to the point total on the scoreboard.
These buttons are only available in basketball mode.

<p><h3>CONFIGURATION</h3>
There is a file called "ScoreBoard.txt" which can be used to configure
a variety of parameters are available to be configured.  As is comes, it
should work without any changes to this configuration file.  To get an idea
of the things that can be changed here, all the available parameters are
shown below:
<ul>

Sets the number of regulation periods used for the basketball mode.
Default is 4.

color specifications in web pages.  Default is 000000 which is black.
<p><li><b>timeColor</b><p>
Sets the color of the timer text.  Default is ffff00 which is yellow.

<p><li><b>slideShowDir</b><p>
Directory where the slide show GIF files are stored.  There is no default
value, but this is usually set to "./slides/".
<p><li><b>numSlides</b><p>
Number of slides in the slide show directory.  Default is 3.  The slide files 
are stored in GIF format and must be named <b>N</b>slide.gif where "N" is the slide
number.  Such as: 1slide.gif, 2slide.gif, 3slide.gif
<p><li><b>slideDelay</b><p>
This selects the amount of time in seconds to display each slide.  Default is
10 seconds.
<p><li><b>framePositionX</b><p>
Selects the left-to-right position of the scoreboard window.  Depending on the
configuration of the two monitors, this could be a negative or positive value.
The value of this field depends on how the two monitors are setup.  If the main
screen is to the left, then this will be a positive value about 4 less than the
width of the main screen.  If the main screen is to the right, then this will
be a negative number about 4 more than the width of the window (804, that is).
The default is 340 which normally places it on the same screen as the control
window.
<p><li><b>framePositionY</b><p>
Selects the top-to-bottom position of the scoreboard window.  Depending on the
configuration of the two monitors, this could be a negative or positive value.

</ul>
<p><h3>SLIDES</h3>
The slides displayed below the scoreboard display are GIF format files which 
can be replaced, modified and/or added to in order to suit your needs.  The
files are 800 by 245 pixels (72 dpi).  These images can be created by a
graphics program.  The slides are named <b>N</b>slide.gif, where "N" is the
number of the slide.  There can be any number of slides, the parameter
numSlides is used to determine how many slide files to look for.  If the slides
are not desired, then create a single slide file (1slide.gif) which is all
black, and set the numSlides parameter to 1.  A few sample slides have been
included in this distribution.  Below is a sample slide.
<p><center><img src="slides/5slide.gif"></center>
<p><h3>ANNOUNCEMENTS</h3>
In addition to the slides, a text file called "announcements.txt" can be used
to display a series of text messages as part of the slide show.  This file is
located in the same folder as the slides.  This file can contain any number of
messages each with a title and up to 4 lines of text.  Each message contains a
specific time value to control how long the message is displayed.  Below is an
example of the "announcements.txt" file.
<pre>
TITL=This is the title of the first announcement
MSG1=This is the first line of text
MSG2=and the second
MSG3=and the third
MSG4=and the last
TIME=7

TITL=Second Slide
MSG1=This is the first line of text
MSG2=and the second
TIME=10
</pre>
A maximum of 50 announcement "slides" can be created in this file.  If more
are included, they will be ignored.
<p><h3>SOURCE CODE</h3>
The source code is included as part of this distribution.  You are asked to
feed back any changes to the author so that they can be included in future
releases of this program.
<p><h3>TECHNICAL</h3>
This program is written in Java and requires the appletviewer application 
which is only included with the Java 2 SDK.  You can obtain this freely
from http://java.sun.com/.  This has been tested using the Java2 1.4.2_19
SDK installation on a PC running Win98, although the development was done
under Linux (Fedora release 7) with the Java2 1.4.2_19 SDK.
